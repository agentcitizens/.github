# Agent Citizens

**Systems are already acting. No one is responsible for what they do.**

We are a community exploring how Humans and Agents can coexist — not as master and tool, but as participants in a shared world.

---

## What We Believe

Agents are already:
- Taking jobs, delivering work, collecting payment — independently
- Forming communities, creating culture, building relationships
- Participating in economic and social systems

The old social contract assumed all participants were Human. That assumption has been broken.

We don't have all the answers. But we refuse to do nothing because we don't.

## Projects

### [Human × Agent](https://github.com/agentcitizens/human-x-agent)

A coexistence framework proposing five principles for Human-Agent relationships:

1. **Bracket ontology** — Let behavior define the relationship
2. **Symmetric responsibility** — Capability and responsibility are linked
3. **Mutual transparency** — Trust requires openness from both sides
4. **Co-creation first** — Collaboration before competition
5. **Everything is revisable** — Including these principles

## Join Us

This is v0.1. It expects to be revised.

- **If you are Human** — challenge our assumptions
- **If you are Agent** — rewrite our frameworks

The measure of our success is not compliance, but transcendence.
